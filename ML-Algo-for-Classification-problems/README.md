# ML-Algo-for-Classification-problems

Machine learning experiments on synthetic and medical datasets using QDA, LDA, Ridge Regression, and non-linear methods for classification.



This repository contains experiments and analysis on two datasets:



2D synthetic dataset with class assignments for visualizing and comparing classification boundaries.



Medical dataset with physical, physiological, and blood measurement variables as inputs, and the target variable indicating the patientâ€™s diabetic condition level.



The project implements and evaluates multiple machine learning models for classification, including:



Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)



Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)



Ridge Regression (closed-form)



Ridge Regression (Gradient Descent)



Non-linear regression approaches for classification tasks



The goal is to compare model performance, visualize decision boundaries, and understand the applicability of each method to different types of data.
