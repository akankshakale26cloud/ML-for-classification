# ML Algorithms for Classification Problems

This repository presents **machine learning experiments** focused on classification tasks using both **synthetic** and **medical** datasets.  
The implemented methods include **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, **Ridge Regression**, and various **non-linear classification techniques**.

## Datasets
- **2D Synthetic Dataset**: Designed to visualize and compare classification boundaries across models with clearly defined class labels.  
- **Medical Dataset**: Contains physical, physiological, and blood measurement features, with the target variable representing the patientâ€™s diabetic condition level.

## Implemented Models
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)  
- Ridge Regression (closed-form solution)  
- Ridge Regression (using Gradient Descent)  
- Non-linear regression methods adapted for classification tasks  

## Objectives
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms  
- Visualize decision boundaries to understand model behavior on synthetic data  
- Analyze the suitability of each approach for complex real-world data like medical records
